Abstract = {Purpose: This paper introduces Pohang University of Science Technology (POSTECH) advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and Open Innovation Big Data Center (OIBC) platform and analysis results of electricity consumption data collected via the AMI in POSTECH campus.
Methods: We installed 248 sensors in seven buildings at POSTECH for the AMI and collected electricity consumption data from the buildings. To identify the amounts and trends of electricity consumption of the seven buildings, electricity consumption data collected from March to June 2019 were analyzed. In addition, this study compared the differences between the amounts and trends of electricity consumption of the seven buildings before and after the COVID-19 outbreak by using electricity consumption data collected from March to June 2019 and 2020.
Results: Users can monitor, visualize, and download electricity consumption data collected via the AMI on the OIBC platform. The analysis results show that the seven buildings consume different amounts of electricity and have different consumption trends. In addition, the amounts of most buildings were significantly reduced after the COVID-19 outbreak.
Conclusion: POSTECH AMI and OIBC platform can be a good reference for other universities that prepare their own microgrid. The analysis results provides a proof that POSTECH needs to establish customized strategies on reducing electricity for each building. Such results would be useful for energy-efficient operation and preparation of unusual energy consumptions due to unexpected situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.}

abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the intrusive feeling caused by a Lane Keeping Assistance System (LKAS) and measure it objectively through the sensor log data of a vehicle. Background: LKAS, one of the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), directly intervenes in the steering wheel control to assist the driver to keep the lane. Due to the torque generated by the LKAS, the driver has a different and undesirable feeling from a usual situation, which can affect the driving experience. Nevertheless, the performance of the LKAS in most studies focused only on how well the system keeps the lane. 
Method: Through an actual driving test using a test vehicle equipped with an LKAS, two ADAS experts and two human factor experts observed the intrusive feeling while collecting sensor log data at the same time. After the types of the intrusive feeling were classified, variables that could account for the feeling were derived. Then, this study compared the data collected from the vehicle with and without the intrusive feeling. 
Results: Three types of the intrusive feeling were observed: abrupt lateral change, steering wheel vibration, and heavy steering. The lateral speed (LS), the high-pass filtered steering angle (FSA), and the interrupt torque (IT) were then derived as the variables that could explain each feeling, respectively. It is found that the patterns of the derived variables are different in driving with and without the intrusive feeling. 
Conclusion and Application: The intrusive feeling found in this study can be used as a performance index in the development stage of the LKAS. It will be helpful to systematically reduce the intrusive feeling.}

abstract = {With the development of the big data environment, public institutions also have been providing big data infrastructures. Public data is one of the typical examples, and numerous applications using public data have been provided. One of the cases is related to the employment insurance. All employers have to make contracts for the employment insurance for all employees to protect the rights. However, there are abundant cases where employers avoid to buy insurances. To overcome these challenges, a data-driven approach is needed; however, there are lacks of methodologies to integrate, manage, and analyze the public data. In this paper, we propose a methodology to build a predictive model for identifying whether employers have made the contracts of employment insurance based on public data. The methodology includes collection, integration, pre-processing, analysis of data and generating prediction models based on process mining and data mining techniques. Also, we verify the methodology with case studies.
(빅데이터의 중요성이 증가함에 따라 공공기관에서는 다양한 빅데이터 관련 인프라를 제공하고 있으며, 그 중 하나가 공공데이터이다. 공공데이터 기반의 다양한 활용 사례가 공유되고 있으며, 공공기관에서도 데이터 기반의 모델을 통해 공공의 문제를 해결하려는 움직임을 보이고 있다. 대표적으로 사회 보험 중 하나인 고용보험 케이스가 있다. 고용보험은 근로자의 권익 보호를 위해 근로자를 고용한 모든 사업주가 필수적으로 가입하여야 하는 보험이지만 가입누락의 경우가 많다. 가입누락을 막기 위한 데이터 기반의 접근이 필요하지만, 분산된 형태의 공공데이터, 수집 시기의 차이로 인해 데이터 통합이 어렵고, 체계적인 방법론이 부재한 상황이다. 본 논문에서는 공공데이터를 기반의 고용보험 가입 예측을 위한 모델 도출 방법론을 제시하고자 한다. 본 방법론은 데이터 수집, 데이터 통합 및 전처리, 데이터 탐색 및 이력 데이터 분석, 예측 모델 도출을 포함하며, 프로세스 마이닝 및 데이터 마이닝을 활용한다. 또한, 사례 연구를 통해 본 방법론의 유효성을 검증한다.)}

volume = {18},
pages = {1-24},
abstract = {Background and objective Recently, Electronic Health Records (EHR) are increasingly being converted to Common Data Models (CDMs), a database schema designed to provide standardized vocabularies to facilitate collaborative observational research. To date, however, rare attempts exist to leverage CDM data for healthcare process mining, a technique to derive process-related knowledge (e.g., process model) from event logs. This paper presents a method to extract, construct, and analyze event logs from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM for process mining and demonstrates CDM-based healthcare process mining with several real-life study cases while answering frequently posed questions in process mining, in the CDM environment.   Methods We propose a method to extract, construct, and analyze event logs from the OMOP CDM for process types including inpatient, outpatient, emergency room processes, and patient journey. Using the proposed method, we extract the retrospective data of several surgical procedure cases (i.e., Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH), Total Hip Replacement (THR), Coronary Bypass (CB), Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD)) from the CDM of a Korean tertiary hospital. Patient data are extracted for each of the operations and analyzed using several process mining techniques.   Results Using process mining, the clinical pathways, outpatient process models, emergency room process models, and patient journeys are demonstrated using the extracted logs. The result shows CDM’s usability as a novel and valuable data source for healthcare process analysis, yet with a few considerations. We found that CDM should be complemented by different internal and external data sources to address the administrative and operational aspects of healthcare processes, particularly for outpatient and ER process analyses.   Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit CDM for healthcare process mining. Specifically, we provide a step-by-step guidance by demonstrating process analysis from locating relevant CDM tables to visualizing results using process mining tools. The proposed method can be widely applicable across different institutions. This work can contribute to bringing a process mining perspective to the existing CDM users in the changing Hospital Information Systems (HIS) environment and also to facilitating CDM-based studies in the process mining research community.},

There are increasing attempts to apply ridesourcing in the corporate context. Manufacturing companies now install the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) sensors to vehicles to obtain real-time data on the movement of goods and materials. Despite the massive amount of data accumulated, little attention has been paid to exploiting the data for vehicle fleet management (FM). This paper proposes an analytical framework to solve two FM problems: how to group organizational units for vehicle sharing and where to deploy the groups. The framework is then validated with a case study of a Korean shipbuilder. The results indicate that grouping departments with similar spatial patterns can reduce the current fleet.},

abstract = {A clinical pathway (CP) is a tool for effectively managing a care process. There are several research efforts on developing clinical pathways (CPs) in the process mining domain. However, the nature of the data affects data analysis results, and patient clinical variability makes it challenging to develop CPs. Thus, it is crucial to determine candidate care processes that can be standardized as CPs before applying process mining techniques. This paper proposed a method for assessing CP feasibility regarding clinical complexity using clinical order logs from electronic health records. The proposed method consists of data preparation, activity & trace homogeneity evaluations, and process inspection using process mining. Each step consists of metrics to measure the homogeneity of processes and a visualization method to demonstrate the diversity of processes based on the log. The case study was conducted with five surgical groups of patients from a tertiary hospital in South Korea to validate the proposed method. The five groups of patients were successfully assessed. In addition, the visualization methods helped clinical experts grasp the diversity of care processes.},

abstract = {Process mining techniques can be used to analyse business processes using the data logged during their execution. These techniques are leveraged in a wide range of domains, including healthcare, where it focuses mainly on the analysis of diagnostic, treatment, and organisational processes. Despite the huge amount of data generated in hospitals by staff and machinery involved in healthcare processes, there is no evidence of a systematic uptake of process mining beyond targeted case studies in a research context. When developing and using process mining in healthcare, distinguishing characteristics of healthcare processes such as their variability and patient-centred focus require targeted attention. Against this background, the Process-Oriented Data Science in Healthcare Alliance has been established to propagate the research and application of techniques targeting the data-driven improvement of healthcare processes. This paper, an initiative of the alliance, presents the distinguishing characteristics of the healthcare domain that need to be considered to successfully use process mining, as well as open challenges that need to be addressed by the community in the future.},

Abstract ={Health information exchange (HIE) refers to the integrated management and secure sharing of health information among healthcare entities. HIE improves healthcare quality and streamlines healthcare administrative work. These advantages have propelled health- care stakeholders to implement HIE. However, challenged by issues such as security, privacy, and costs, HIE is not widespread. Recent studies have suggested blockchain-based HIE for solving security and privacy issues. Unfortunately, existing blockchain-based HIE studies do not consider the privacy issues caused by analyzing senders and receivers of transactions in the blockchain. In this work, we suggest MEXchange, a novel blockchain-based privacy-preserving HIE that prevents the privacy issue by obscuring the sender and concealing receiver addresses. We propose smart contracts and workflow that use ring signature and stealth address for blockchain-based HIE. Software components and implementation of MEXchange on the Ethereum private network are discussed. We evaluate MEXchange quantitatively by measuring the transaction latency and throughput of exchanging. Also, we evaluate MEXchange qualitatively using the requirements of the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). Moreover, we proceed with threat modeling based on STRIDE. Finally, we compare MEXchange with Ancile, FHIRChain, Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (IHE XDS), and MedRec. The MEXchange lowers barriers to the application of blockchain-based HIE systems by mitigating privacy and security issues among healthcare stakeholders.},

We proposed Pass2vec, a passing style descriptor that can characterize each player’s passing style by combining detailed information on passes. Pass data was extracted from the ball event data from five European football leagues in the 2017–2018 season, which was divided into training and test set. The information on location, length, and direction of passes was combined using Convolutional Autoencoder. As a result, pass vectors were generated for each player. We verified the method with the player retrieval task, which successfully retrieved 76.5\% of all players in the top-20 with the descriptor and the result outperformed previous methods. Also, player similarity analysis confirmed the resemblance of players passes on three representative cases, showing the actual application and practical use of the method. The results prove that this novel method for characterizing player’s styles with improved accuracy will enable us to understand passing better for player training and recruitment.},

  abstract={In semiconductor manufacturing, data-driven methodologies have enabled the resolution of various issues, particularly yield management and enhancement. Yield, one of the crucial key performance indicators in semiconductor manufacturing, is mostly affected by production resources, i.e., equipment involved in the process. There is a lot of research on finding the correlation between yield and the status of resources. However, in general, multiple resources are engaged in production processes, which may cause multicollinearity among resources. Therefore, it is important to discover resource paths that are positively or negatively associated with yield. This article proposes a systematic methodology for discovering a resource-oriented transition system model in a semiconductor manufacturing process to identify resource paths resulting in high and low yield. The proposed method is based on the model-based analysis (i.e., finite state machine mining) in process mining and statistical analyses. We conducted an empirical study with real-life data from one of the leading semiconductor manufacturing companies to validate the proposed approach.},

In recent studies, collected data have been processed to provide information on household appliance usage. The noise caused by electrical appliances from neighboring households constitutes a major issue, which is related to discomfort and even mental diseases. The assessment of noise discomfort using electricity consumption data has not been dealt with in the literature up to this day. In this study, a method, which utilizes electricity consumption data for the assessment of noise discomfort levels caused by electrical appliances between neighboring households, is proposed. This method is based on the differences in the usage time of electrical appliances in a collective residential building. The proposed method includes the following four steps: data collection and preprocessing, residential units clustering, noise discomfort modeling, and evaluation of noise discomfort. This method is demonstrated through a case study of a campus apartment building. Variations in the noise discomfort assessment model and measures for alleviating noise discomfort are also discussed. The proposed method can guide the application of electricity consumption data to assessment and alleviation of noise discomfort from home appliances at an apartment building.}

There are a handful of research works focusing on the predictions at the instance level. However, it is more practical to predict the performance of processes at the process model level and detect potential weaknesses in the process to facilitate the proactive actions that will improve the process execution. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel method to predict the future performances of a business process at the process model level. More in detail, we construct an annotated transition system and generate a process representation matrix from it. Based on the process representation matrix, we build performance prediction models using deep neural networks that consider both spatial and temporal dependencies present in the underlying business process.

A clinical pathway is one of the tools used to support clinical decision making that provides a standardized care process in a specific context. The objective of this research was to develop a method for building data-driven clinical pathways using electronic health record data.
Materials and methods
We proposed a matching rate-based clinical pathway mining algorithm that produces the optimal set of clinical orders for each clinical stage by employing matching rates. To validate the approach, we utilized two different datasets of deidentified inpatient records directly related to total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and rotator cuff tears (RCTs) from a hospital in South Korea. The derived data-driven clinical pathways were evaluated with knowledge-based models by health professionals using a delta analysis.
Results
Two different data-driven clinical pathways, i.e., TLH and RCTs, were produced by applying the matching rate-based clinical pathway mining algorithm. We identified that there were significant differences in clinical orders between the data-driven and knowledge-based models. Additionally, the data-driven clinical pathways based on our algorithm outperformed the models by clinical experts, with average matching rates of 82.02% and 79.66%, respectively.
Conclusion
The proposed algorithm will be helpful for supporting clinical decisions and directly applicable in medical practices.},

  abstract={Although the automotive industry has been among the sectors that best-understands the importance of drivers’ affect, the focus of design and research in the automotive field has long emphasized the visceral aspects of exterior and interior design. With the adoption of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), endowing ‘semi-autonomy’ to the vehicles, however, the scope of affective design should be expanded to include the behavioural aspects of the vehicle. In such a ‘shared-control’ system wherein the vehicle can intervene in the human driver’s operations, a certain degree of ‘intrusive feelings’ are unavoidable. For example, when the Lane Keeping Assistance System (LKAS), one of the most popular examples of ADAS, operates the steering wheel in a dangerous situation, the driver may feel interrupted or surprised because of the abrupt torque generated by LKAS. This kind of unpleasant experience can lead to prolonged negative feelings such as irritation, anxiety, and distrust of the system. Therefore, there are increasing needs of investigating the driver’s affective responses towards the vehicle’s dynamic behaviour. In this study, four types of intrusive feelings caused by LKAS were identified to be proposed as a quantitative performance indicator in designing the affectively satisfactory behaviour of LKAS. A metric as well as a statistical data analysis method to quantitatively measure the intrusive feelings through the vehicle sensor log data.}

The spread of the content generated by users is crucial in SNS, but there is only a handful of research works on information diffusion and, more precisely, information diffusion flow. In this paper, we propose a novel method to discover information diffusion processes from SNS data. The method starts preprocessing the SNS data using a user-centric algorithm of community detection based on modularity maximization with the purpose of reducing the complexity of the noisy data. After that, the InfoFlow miner generates information diffusion flow models among the user communities discovered from the data. The algorithm is an extension of a traditional process discovery technique called the Flexible Heuristics miner, but the visualization ability of the generated process model is improved with a new measure called response weight, which effectively captures and represents the interactions among communities. An experiment with Facebook data was conducted, and information flow among user communities was visualized. Additionally, a quality assessment of the models was carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The final constructed models allowed us to identify useful information such as how the information flows between communities and information disseminators and receptors within communities.},

  abstract={In healthcare management, waiting time for consultation is an important measure that has strong associations with patient's satisfaction (i.e., the longer patients wait for consultation, the less satisfied they are). To this end, it is required to optimize medical scheduling for clinicians. A typical approach for deriving the optimized schedules is to perform experiments using discrete event simulation. The existing work has developed how to build a simulation model based on process mining techniques. However, applying this method for outpatient processes straightforwardly, in particular medical scheduling, is challenging: 1) the collected data from electronic health record system requires a series of processes to acquire simulation parameters from the raw data; and 2) even if the derived simulation model fully reflects the reality, there is no systematic approach to deriving effective improvements for simulation analysis, i.e., experimental scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel decision support framework for a clinician's schedule using simulation analysis. In the proposed framework, a data-driven simulation model is constructed based on process mining analysis, which includes process discovery, patient arrival rate analysis, and service time analysis. Also, a series of steps to derive the optimal improvement method from the simulation analysis is included in the framework. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we present the case study results with real-world data in a hospital.}

The length of stay (LOS) is an important indicator of the efficiency of hospital management. Reduction in the number of inpatient days results in decreased risk of infection and medication side effects, improvement in the quality of treatment, and increased hospital profit with more efficient bed management. The purpose of this study was to determine which factors are associated with length of hospital stay, based on electronic health records, in order to manage hospital stay more efficiently.

Materials and methods

Research subjects were retrieved from a database of patients admitted to a tertiary general university hospital in South Korea between January and December 2013. Patients were analyzed according to the following three categories: descriptive and exploratory analysis, process pattern analysis using process mining techniques, and statistical analysis and prediction of LOS.

Results

Overall, 55% (25,228) of inpatients were discharged within 4 days. The department of rehabilitation medicine (RH) had the highest average LOS at 15.9 days. Of all the conditions diagnosed over 250 times, diagnoses of I63.8 (cerebral infarction, middle cerebral artery), I63.9 (infarction of middle cerebral artery territory) and I21.9 (myocardial infarction) were associated with the longest average hospital stay and high standard deviation. Patients with these conditions were also more likely to be transferred to the RH department for rehabilitation. A range of variables, such as transfer, discharge delay time, operation frequency, frequency of diagnosis, severity, bed grade, and insurance type was significantly correlated with the LOS.

Conclusions

Accurate understanding of the factors associating with the LOS and progressive improvements in processing and monitoring may allow more efficient management of the LOS of inpatients.}

This paper proposes a business process assessment framework focused on the process redesign lifecycle phase and tightly coupled with process mining as an operational framework to calculate indicators. The framework includes process performance indicators and indicators to assess whether process redesign best practices have been applied and to what extent. Both sets of indicators can be calculated using standard process mining functionality. This, implicitly, also defines what data must be collected during process execution to enable their calculation. The framework is evaluated through case studies and a thorough comparison against other approaches in the literature.}

abstract={Process discovery is a type of process mining that constructs a process model from the event logs of an information system. The model discovered using process discovery techniques and the process as perceived by users will always differ in some ways and to some extents. In particular, less structured process, such as operational process in business and manufacturing, often result overly confusing, spaghetti-like, process models caused by the inherent complexity of the process. As a result, the mined model has many limitations for providing the users with explicit knowledge that can be directly used to influence behavior for the user’s interest. Explicit knowledge, as later called by actionable knowledge, is an important representation on measuring the interestingness of mined patterns. This actionable knowledge, which is incorporated with users’ background knowledge and based on some notions of actionable rules, can result an actionable process model. Undoubtedly, domain experts, who know the process well, play a key role to enhance the mined model into an actionable model by their involvements during the discovery process. This paper presents a discovery method to obtain an actionable process model that is based on both the event relation in the log and users’ knowledge to improve the incompatibility of the traditional process mining approaches. Users can set their knowledge in terms of constraints. Unlike the existing approach, the proposed approach synthesizes the activity proximity and attempts to extract behavior satisfied by the constraints which may be hidden in the event logs for resulting an actionable process model. In addition, the proposed method is used in order to achieve a sound process model when the existence of the constraints does not satisfy the workflow soundness property. The method was implemented in the ProM framework and tested on a real process.}

Many hospitals are increasing their efforts to improve processes because processes play an important role in enhancing work efficiency and reducing costs. However, to date, a quantitative tool has not been available to examine the before and after effects of processes and environmental changes, other than the use of indirect indicators, such as mortality rate and readmission rate.
Methods
This study used process mining technology to analyze process changes based on changes in the hospital environment, such as the construction of a new building, and to measure the effects of environmental changes in terms of consultation wait time, time spent per task, and outpatient care processes. Using process mining technology, electronic health record (EHR) log data of outpatient care before and after constructing a new building were analyzed, and the effectiveness of the technology in terms of the process was evaluated.
Results
Using the process mining technique, we found that the total time spent in outpatient care did not increase significantly compared to that before the construction of a new building, considering that the number of outpatients increased, and the consultation wait time decreased. These results suggest that the operation of the outpatient clinic was effective after changes were implemented in the hospital environment. We further identified improvements in processes using the process mining technique, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of this technique for analyzing complex hospital processes at a low cost.
Conclusion
This study confirmed the effectiveness of process mining technology at an actual hospital site. In future studies, the use of process mining technology will be expanded by applying this approach to a larger variety of process change situations.}

title={Collection and Analysis of Electricity Consumption Data: The Case of POSTECH Campus},
journal={Proceedings of INFORMS Conference on Service Science, Virtual, December 19-21},
year={2020},
document_type={Conference Paper},
abstract={Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is an integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management systems. The AMI allows the automatic and remote measurement and monitoring of energy consumption. It also provides important information for the management of peak demand and energy consumption and costs. Pohang University of Science Technology (POSTECH) has developed its own AMI and an IT platform called Open Innovation Big Data Center (OIBC) to store and share various data collected in the campus. In this work, we describe the AMI and the OIBC platform equipped with various sensors and systems for measuring, storing, calling, and monitoring data. Data are collected from seven buildings with different characteristics. We installed 266 sensors at the buildings, including 188 EnerTalk and Biz, 18 plugin, and 60 high-sampling sensors. The sensors collect electricity consumption data in real time, and users can visualize and download the data through the OIBC platform. In this work, we present analysis results of the collected data. The results show that the amounts of electricity consumed by campus buildings are different depending on various factors, including building size, occupant type and their behaviors, and building use. We also compare the amounts of electricity consumed before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The information extracted can be used to improve the satisfaction of students and faculty as well as the efficiency of electricity management.}

title={Household Assignment Considering Appliance Noise Discomfort between Neighbors and Housing Preference: A Case Study of a Campus Apartment Building},
journal={INFORMS Annual Meeting, Virtual, November 7-13},
year={2020},
document_type={Conference Paper},
abstract={When households move into empty units in a collective residential building, appliance noise discomfort (ND) between neighbors and housing preference (HP) are important considerations. This study proposes a model to assign households with the goal of minimizing ND and unsatisfied HP, and demonstrates the application of the model through a case study at a campus apartment building. ND levels are calculated by an approach that utilizes electricity usage data and identifies time difference in appliance usage between neighbors. Items of HP are extracted from interviews with residents living in the building. This study discusses assignment results under various scenarios through sensitivity analysis. The proposed model can help to assign households considering ND and HP in a collective building in practice.}
